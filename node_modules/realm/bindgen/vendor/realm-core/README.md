Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables - check out [realm.io](https://realm.io).

This repository holds the source code for the core database component used by all the Realm Mobile Database products:

* [Realm C++](https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp)
* [Realm Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/realm/realm-dart)
* [Realm Java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java)
* [Realm Kotlin](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin)
* [Realm Swift/Objective-C](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift)
* [Realm .NET](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet)
* [Realm Node.js/React Native/Web](https://github.com/realm/realm-js)

Realm Core is not in itself an "end-user" product with a publicly stable and supported API.
